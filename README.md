# Mouse-Accuracy-Bot

A python bot that I made, yes it is only 14 lines of code lol but very efficent! A great learning experience for me, feel free to edit the code improve it. 

# Note
This only works on the color red, so make sure to change the target color to red. If you would like to add support for other colors its easy, take a screenshot of it and replace "redball.png"
